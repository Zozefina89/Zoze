            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Josephine Paysanidou, a dynamic and versatile professional based in Athens, Greece. I graduated from the Athens University of Economics and Business and further enriched my education by studying as an exchange student at The Hague University. As an economist, I bring strong analytical and strategic skills to my work, helping to craft effective financial solutions.</p>
            <p>Sports have always been a significant part of my life. From an early age, I have excelled in basketball, football, and athletics. Nowadays, my focus is on football, where I play in the second division of Greece. In addition to playing, I am a certified soccer coach for developmental ages, holding a UEFA C diploma.</p>
            <p>On the personal front, I am a proud mother of two wonderful children and am happily married to a Hellenic Air Force pilot. My ability to multitask and manage various responsibilities efficiently allows me to balance my professional, athletic, and family life. I also have a passion for creativity, whether it’s designing websites on free platforms or decorating homes to make them inviting and stylish.</p>
